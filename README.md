# Tranception Evaluation

Calculation for various sequence- and structure-based quality scores for proteins, such as those produced by generative models.

1. Structue metrics
2. Single-sequence metrics
3. Alignment-based metrics

## Directories
**PDBs**: Single Chain A with scores in b-factor field (Generated by AlphaFold2)

**Target Sequences**: For both single-sequence and alignment-based metrics

**Reference Sequences**: For alignment-based metrics
***

## Example usage
1. Scoring with single-sequence and alignment-based metrics only
```
python  protein_scoring.py \
        --output_name [directory (inside this folder) to store the output csv] \
        --target_dir [directory of target sequences in FASTA format] \
        --reference_dir [directory of reference sequences in FASTA format]
```

2. Scoring with all metrics (including structure-based metrics)
```
srun python Tranception-Evaluation/protein_scoring.py \
        --score_structure [flag to include structure-based metrics] \
        --output_name [directory (inside this folder) to store the output csv] \
        --target_dir [directory of target sequences in FASTA format] \
        --reference_dir [directory of reference sequences in FASTA format] \
        --pdb_dir [directory of target sequences in pdb format] \
        --ref_pdb_dir [directory of reference sequences in pdb format]
```
